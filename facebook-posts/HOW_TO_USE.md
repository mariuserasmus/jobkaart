# Facebook Post Images - How to Use

I've created 3 professional Facebook post designs for you. Here's how to use them:

---

## Step 1: Open Each Design

You'll find 3 HTML files in this folder:
1. **design-1-lost-money.html** - Purple gradient, focuses on money lost
2. **design-2-before-after.html** - Before vs After split screen
3. **design-3-testimonial.html** - Testimonial style with stats

**To view them:**
- Double-click each HTML file
- It will open in your web browser
- The design is sized perfectly for Facebook (1080x1080px square)

---

## Step 2: Take a Screenshot

### On Windows:
1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Press **F11** to go fullscreen (hides browser bars)
3. Press **Windows Key + Shift + S** (Snipping Tool)
4. Drag to select the entire design
5. The screenshot is automatically saved to your clipboard
6. Open Paint or Photos and paste (Ctrl+V)
7. Save as PNG or JPG

### Alternative (Easier):
1. Open the HTML file
2. Right-click on the page
3. Select "Save as PDF" or "Print"
4. Choose "Save as PDF"
5. Then use any PDF to Image converter online

### On Mac:
1. Open the HTML file
2. Press **Cmd + Shift + 4**
3. Drag to select the design
4. Screenshot saves to Desktop automatically

## Step 3: Post to Facebook

### **IMPORTANT: How to Post (Don't Get Throttled!)**

**❌ DON'T do this:**
```

```
*This will still get throttled because of the link*

**✅ DO this instead:**

### Option A: Question Format (Best Engagement)
```
[Post the image]

Caption:
Fellow tradies - be honest:

How many quotes did you send this month that you never followed up on?

Comment below with your number. I bet it's costing you more than you think.

💬 Drop a comment and I'll show you the math.
```

Then reply to comments with:
```
Yeah boet, that's probably costing you R8k-12k per month.

I built a tool to fix this exact problem - auto-reminders so you never forget.
DM me if you want the link, I'll set you up personally (free 14-day trial).
```

---

### Option B: Story Format (More Personal)
```
[Post the image]

Caption:
Real talk: I used to lose 2-3 quotes per month because I'd forget to follow up.

Customer says "let me think about it" and it falls through the cracks.
Two weeks later I remember, but they've already hired someone else.

That's R8,000-12,000 gone every month. 💸

Anyone else do this? Or is it just me? 😅

(Comment "guilty" if you've done this too)
```

Then post the link in the FIRST COMMENT:
```
For anyone curious, I built JobKaart to fix this problem for myself:
https://jobkaart.co.za

Free 14-day trial. Auto-reminders after 3 days. No credit card needed.
```

---

### Option C: Value-First Approach
```
[Post the image]

Caption:
Quick question for plumbers, electricians, and other quote-based tradies:

What's your follow-up rate on quotes?

Most tradies I talk to have a 30-40% follow-up rate.
That means 60-70% of quotes just... disappear.

If you're sending 10 quotes a month at R4,000 each, that's potentially
R24,000 in lost opportunities.

Want to know the system I use to never forget a quote again?

Drop a 👋 in the comments and I'll share it.
```

## Which Design Should You Use?

### **Design 1: Lost Money (Purple Gradient)**
**Best for:** Grabbing attention with the pain point
**Use when:** Posting in general tradie groups
**Caption style:** Question format ("How many quotes did you forget?")

### **Design 2: Before vs After (Split Screen)**
**Best for:** Showing the transformation clearly
**Use when:** People already know about the problem
**Caption style:** Story format ("I used to be Before, now I'm After")

### **Design 3: Testimonial (White with Quote)**
**Best for:** Building trust and credibility
**Use when:** You have a real user story (even if it's hypothetical for now)
**Caption style:** Value-first approach ("Here's what Johan experienced")

## Pro Tips for Maximum Reach:

### 1. **Post at Peak Times**
- **Best times for SA tradies:**
  - Tuesday-Thursday: 7-8am (before work starts)
  - Tuesday-Thursday: 6-8pm (after work, scrolling time)
- **Worst times:**
  - Weekends (people aren't thinking about work)
  - Monday mornings (too busy)

### 2. **Use the Right Groups**
Post in groups like:
- "South African Plumbers"
- "Electricians South Africa"
- "SA Small Business Owners"
- "Tradie Talk SA"
- "Handyman Services South Africa"

### 3. **Don't Spam**
- Post in max 3-4 groups per day
- Space them out (morning, lunch, evening)
- Use different captions for each group
- Wait 2-3 days before posting again

### 4. **Engage FAST**
- When someone comments, reply within 5 minutes
- Facebook sees engagement and shows your post to more people
- Every comment = more reach

### 5. **Track What Works**
After each post, check Google Analytics:
1. Go to analytics.google.com
2. Reports → Realtime
3. See if people are clicking through

Make a note:
- Design 1 + Question format = 12 clicks
- Design 2 + Story format = 3 clicks
- Design 3 + Value format = 18 clicks

**Double down on what works!**

2. Find the text you want to change (it's in plain English, easy to find)
3. Change it
4. Save the file
