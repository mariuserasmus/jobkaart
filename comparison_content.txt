Why JobKaart?
The honest comparison: WhatsApp+Notebook vs JobKaart
A cheat sheet for sales conversations with tradespeople
The Core Problem
Most tradespeople currently use:
WhatsApp — for customer communication
Notebook in the bakkie — for quotes and job notes
Excel/wife — for invoicing (maybe)
Their head — for everything else
This "system" is FREE. So why pay R299/month?
Because "free" is costing them thousands.
The Hidden Costs of "Free"
The "Free" Problem
What It's Actually Costing
Can't find customer's number in WhatsApp
15 minutes searching = R150 of your time (at R600/hr)
Quote written on paper goes through wash
R4,000-R8,000 job lost
Forget to follow up on quote
Customer goes to competitor
Finish job, forget to invoice
R3,000 sitting uncollected for weeks
No idea who owes you money
R10,000-R30,000 outstanding (you just don't know)
Wife can't invoice without calling you
1 hour/day of phone calls = lost productivity
Notebook stolen from bakkie overnight
All customer info + outstanding quotes = GONE
The Maths That Wins The Argument
Ask them: "How many quotes do you send per month?"
Typical answer: 15-30 quotes
Ask them: "How many do you forget to follow up?"
Typical answer: "A few..." (usually 2-3)
Ask them: "What's your average quote value?"
Typical answer: R3,000-R5,000
Now do the maths together:
Forgotten quotes per month
2-3
Average quote value
R4,000
Potential lost revenue per month
R8,000 - R12,000
JobKaart cost
R299/month
If JobKaart recovers just ONE quote...
R3,701 NET PROFIT
That's a 1,238% return on investment.

Handling Objections
"R299 is expensive — I'll stick with WhatsApp"
Response: "I hear you. Quick question: how many quotes did you send last month that you never followed up on? [Wait for answer] At R4,000 average, that's R8,000-12,000 potentially lost. R299 to recover even ONE of those is a 1,300% return. Free isn't free if it's costing you jobs."
"I'm not tech-savvy"
Response: "Can you use WhatsApp? Then you can use JobKaart. It's actually simpler than WhatsApp — just 5 buttons. Most people figure it out in 10 minutes. And if you get stuck, we help you set it up."
"I'll think about it"
Response: "No problem. While you're thinking, how many quotes will you send this week? And how many will you remember to follow up on? Every week you wait is another R8,000 potentially walking out the door. But no pressure — join the waiting list and we'll remind you when we launch."
"What about ServCraft / Tradify?"
Response: "Great products if you have a team of 5+ and need GPS tracking, complex scheduling, all that. But they charge R299 PER USER. For a 3-person team, that's R897/month. JobKaart is R299 flat — your whole team. We focus on 5 features done really well, not 20 features you'll never use."

The Bottom Line
JobKaart is for tradies who:
Send quotes and wait for acceptance (plumbers, electricians, painters, handymen)
Are losing money to forgotten follow-ups
Want their wife/partner to help with invoicing
Don't need 20 complex features
Just want 5 things that work damn well
JobKaart is NOT for:
Contract-only businesses (weekly garden service, cleaning)
Product sellers (bakers, crafters, e-commerce)
Appointment-based businesses (salons, tutors)
Large teams needing GPS tracking and complex scheduling
Taking the wrong customer hurts more than losing a sale.
Know who to sign up, and who to politely decline.
