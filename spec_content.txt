Why This Matters

3. Month Comparison:

7. WhatsApp Integration
Critical for SA market: WhatsApp is how tradies communicate with customers.
Approach: Click-to-Chat (No API Pain)
Instead of complex WhatsApp Business API integration, we use smart linking:
How it works:
User taps "Send via WhatsApp"
App generates public link to quote/invoice (e.g., jobkaart.co.za/q/abc123)
WhatsApp opens with pre-filled message containing link
User taps Send in WhatsApp
When customer clicks link, JobKaart tracks: "Quote viewed at 14:32"
Benefits of This Approach
Click-to-Chat ✓
Full WhatsApp API ✗
Zero setup time
10-40 hours setup
No META verification needed
Facebook Business verification required
FREE (no cost per message)
R0.30-0.80 per message
Works on user's existing WhatsApp
Requires separate business number
User must tap Send (2 seconds)
Fully automatic
Track quote views via link clicks ✓
Full delivery tracking
The trade-off (user taps Send) is worth it for zero complexity and zero cost.

ROI Justification
The question isn't "Is R299 expensive?" — it's "Is R299 worth it compared to free?"
Average tradie loses 2-3 quotes/month they forget to follow up
Average quote value: R4,000
Lost per month: R8,000 - R12,000
JobKaart cost: R299/month
If JobKaart helps recover ONE quote = R3,701 net profit that month
ROI: 1,238%
