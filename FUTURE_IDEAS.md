## Marketplace & Discovery

### 💡 IDEA #1: Tradie Marketplace (Uber for Tradies)

**Added**: December 2025
**Status**: 🤔 Exploring
**Priority**: TBD

#### The Concept
Create a public-facing marketplace where customers can find and book JobKaart tradies based on:
- Trade type (plumber, electrician, handyman, etc.)
- Geographic area
- Ratings & reviews
- Availability

#### How It Might Work

**Customer Side:**
- Visit jobkaart.co.za homepage
- Select trade type + area
- See list of available tradies with ratings
- View tradie profiles (completed jobs, reviews, response time)
- Request a quote or booking
- Rate the tradie after job completion

**Tradie Side:**
- Opt-in to be listed on marketplace
- Set service areas & trade categories
- Receive quote requests through JobKaart
- Accept/decline requests
- Rate customers after job (flag problem customers)

**Two-Way Rating System:**
- Tradies rate customers (payment speed, respect, realistic expectations)
- Customers rate tradies (quality, punctuality, professionalism)
- Poor ratings on either side = warnings or removal

#### Strategic Questions to Answer

**1. Integration with JobKaart:**
- Separate app/platform or integrated into JobKaart?
- Does tradie need paid subscription to be listed?
- FREE tier users allowed in marketplace?

**2. Revenue Model Options:**
- Commission per job (10-15% like Uber)?
- Lead fees (R50-200 per quote request)?
- Premium marketplace placement (R299/month extra)?
- FREE listing for paid JobKaart users, paid for FREE tier?
- Combination model?

**3. Customer Acquisition:**
- How do customers find the marketplace?
- SEO strategy (rank for "plumber Cape Town", etc.)?
- Google Ads for customer searches?
- Free directory listing to drive traffic?

**4. Competitive Positioning:**
- Similar to: SweepSouth, FixerHub, Airtasker
- Difference: Only JobKaart users (implies organized, professional)
- Benefit: Pre-vetted as JobKaart users = more reliable

**5. Value Proposition for Tradies:**
- More leads = more jobs
- Credibility boost (featured on platform)
- Quality filter (bad customers get flagged)
- Easier to stay busy between existing clients

**6. Value Proposition for Customers:**
- Find reliable tradies quickly
- See ratings & completed jobs
- Know who's available in their area
- Less risk (rating system protects them)

#### Potential Benefits

**For JobKaart Business:**
- ✅ Drives new tradie signups (need JobKaart to be listed)
- ✅ Additional revenue stream (commission or lead fees)
- ✅ Increases platform stickiness (more value = less churn)
- ✅ Network effects (more tradies = more customers = more tradies)
- ✅ SEO boost from customer searches

**For Tradies:**
- ✅ New customer source without marketing cost
- ✅ Fill gaps in schedule
- ✅ Build reputation through ratings
- ✅ Avoid problem customers (two-way ratings)

**For Customers:**
- ✅ Easy to find reliable tradies
- ✅ Transparent pricing expectations
- ✅ Review-based trust
- ✅ Local service providers

#### Potential Risks & Challenges

**Chicken & Egg Problem:**
- Need tradies to attract customers
- Need customers to attract tradies
- Solution: Start with existing JobKaart users as supply

**Quality Control:**
- Bad tradies damage platform reputation
- Need verification/vetting process
- Minimum rating threshold to stay listed?

**Commission Resistance:**
- Tradies may resist giving up 10-15% per job
- Counter: "You wouldn't have gotten this customer otherwise"
- Alternative: Flat lead fee instead of commission

**Customer Expectations:**
- Instant availability expectations (like Uber)
- Tradies may not be available same-day
- Manage expectations: "Request quotes, typical response 2-4 hours"

**Platform Disintermediation:**
- Customer books through platform once, then goes direct
- Solution: Value needs to be strong enough to keep them on platform
- Multi-booking incentives (discounts for repeat platform bookings?)

**Competition:**
- Airtasker, SweepSouth, FixerHub already exist
- Difference: We have the tradie management system built-in
- They'd need JobKaart + another platform; we're one system

#### Technical Considerations

**New Features Needed:**
- Public-facing marketplace frontend
- Tradie profile pages (portfolio, reviews, service areas)
- Quote request system
- Booking calendar integration
- Rating & review system
- Customer accounts (separate from tradie accounts)
- Payment escrow system? (optional - could be invoice-based)
- SMS/email notifications for new requests

**Integration with Current System:**
- Quote requests flow into existing JobKaart quotes
- Marketplace jobs tracked in existing job tracker
- Invoices handled through existing system
- Seamless for tradies (just more leads)

#### Comparable Business Models

**Uber for Services:**
- Customer searches → sees available providers → books → pays → rates
- Platform takes 15-25% commission
- Providers build rating over time

**Airtasker (Australia):**
- Customer posts job → tradies bid → customer picks → job done → payment released
- Tradie pays fee per job (6-15% of job value)
- Two-way rating system

**Thumbtack (USA):**
- Customer posts job → matches tradies → tradies pay for lead
- Lead fees: $5-$50 depending on job size
- No commission on actual work

**SweepSouth (SA):**
- Customers book cleaning services
- Cleaners are vetted and background-checked
- Platform handles payments and scheduling

#### Next Steps to Validate

- [ ] Survey existing JobKaart users: Would you pay 10% commission for qualified leads?
- [ ] Survey existing JobKaart users: How many new customers per month would make this worthwhile?
- [ ] Research SA customer behavior: Do they use online platforms to find tradies?
- [ ] Analyze competitor platforms: What works, what doesn't?
- [ ] Prototype simple landing page: "Find a plumber in [area]" - test Google Ads
- [ ] Calculate economics: What's customer acquisition cost vs lifetime value?
- [ ] Decide: Integrated or separate platform?
- [ ] Decide: Revenue model (commission vs lead fees vs hybrid)

#### Potential Phases

**Phase 1: Simple Directory (MVP)**
- Public directory of JobKaart tradies (opt-in)
- Search by trade + area
- Contact tradie via platform (sends to their JobKaart)
- NO payments, NO bookings, NO ratings yet
- Goal: Test demand, see if customers use it

**Phase 2: Quote Requests**
- Customers can request quotes through platform
- Tradie receives in their JobKaart dashboard
- Tradie responds with quote
- Still no payments through platform

**Phase 3: Ratings & Reviews**
- Add rating system after job completion
- Two-way ratings (tradie rates customer too)
- Build trust and credibility

**Phase 4: Full Marketplace**
- Booking system
- Payment processing
- Commission/fees collection
- Advanced matching algorithms
