A Day in Johan's Life (Before JobTrack)
7:00 AM: Johan checks WhatsApp. 47 unread messages across various customer chats. He scrolls trying to find the address for today's first job.
9:30 AM: Customer asks for a quote on a geyser replacement. Johan writes notes on a piece of paper, stuffs it in his pocket.
12:00 PM: A customer calls asking about a quote Johan sent 2 weeks ago. Johan can't remember what he quoted. Awkward.
5:00 PM: Johan tells his wife about 3 jobs he finished. She asks for details to create invoices. He can't remember exact amounts.
8:00 PM: The piece of paper with the geyser quote details has gone through the wash. Customer never gets quoted.
Johan's Pain Points
Loses track of quotes sent — forgets to follow up
Customer details scattered across WhatsApp, notebook, wife's phone
No idea who owes him money at any given time
Quotes look unprofessional (plain WhatsApp messages)
Wife frustrated with incomplete info for invoicing

Case Study 2: Sipho — Electrician with Small Team
  ★★★★★ EXCELLENT FIT — Ideal for teams of 2-5  
Business Profile
Business
Sipho Electrical Solutions
Location
Johannesburg East Rand
Team Size
Sipho + 2 qualified electricians + 1 apprentice
Jobs per Month
60-80 jobs across the team
Average Job Value
R2,000 - R25,000
Monthly Revenue
R150,000 - R250,000
Current Tools
WhatsApp group, shared Google Sheet, paper job cards
Sipho's Specific Challenges
Team members update the shared spreadsheet inconsistently
Sipho quotes, but doesn't know if his guys completed the work
Compliance certificates (COCs) get lost in WhatsApp photos
No visibility into which jobs are profitable vs. losing money
Invoices delayed because he doesn't know jobs are complete
How JobTrack Helps Sipho's Team
Each team member has login — updates job status from their phone
Job photos (including COCs) attached to job record, not lost in chat
Dashboard shows jobs by status — Sipho sees what's happening in real-time
When a job moves to "Complete", Sipho gets notified to invoice
Quote vs. actual tracking shows job profitability (Phase 2)
Recommended Plan: Pro (R499/month)
3 users included (Sipho + 2 electricians)
Unlimited jobs
Quote templates for common jobs (DB board, geyser connection, COC inspection)
Case Study 3: Thandi — Garden Service with Monthly Contracts
  ★★★☆☆ PARTIAL FIT — Works, but needs workarounds  
Business Profile
Business
Thandi's Garden Care
Location
Pretoria East
Team Size
Thandi + 3 garden workers
Business Model
Monthly contracts — visit each client weekly or bi-weekly
Number of Clients
45 residential clients on monthly contracts
Monthly Fee per Client
R800 - R2,500 depending on garden size
Monthly Revenue
~R65,000 (mostly predictable)
Current Tools
Paper schedule on clipboard, invoices in Word document
Why Thandi is Only a PARTIAL Fit
Thandi's business is different from Johan's plumbing work:
What Thandi Needs
JobTrack MVP Status
Recurring monthly invoices (same amount each month)
NOT in MVP — manual workaround required
Weekly schedule template (same clients, same days)
NOT in MVP — Phase 2 feature
Route planning for workers
NOT planned — use Google Maps separately
Track which gardens were serviced this week
YES — mark jobs as complete
Customer contact details
YES — customer database
Once-off jobs (tree removal, new installation)
YES — quote and invoice like plumber
Workaround for Thandi (MVP)
Thandi CAN use JobTrack, but she'll need to:
Create a new "job" each month for each client (instead of auto-recurring)
Manually create monthly invoices (instead of auto-generate)
Use the system mainly for customer records and once-off work
When Thandi WOULD Be a Great Fit
After Phase 2 features are added:
Recurring jobs (set up once, auto-creates monthly)
Recurring invoices (auto-generate on the 1st of each month)
Weekly schedule view (see all visits for the week)
  RECOMMENDATION: Don't actively target garden services for MVP launch. Add to waiting list for Phase 2.  
Case Study 4: Peter — Multi-Skilled Handyman
  ★★★★★ EXCELLENT FIT — High volume, high chaos  
Business Profile
Business
Peter's Property Maintenance
Location
Durban North Coast
Team Size
Just Peter
Services
Painting, tiling, drywall, minor plumbing, carpentry, general repairs
Jobs per Month
40-60 small jobs
Average Job Value
R500 - R5,000 (mostly under R2,000)
Monthly Revenue
R40,000 - R70,000
Why Peter is an EXCELLENT Fit
HIGH VOLUME of small jobs = high chaos potential
Every job is different = can't use a simple schedule
Lots of repeat customers = customer database is valuable
Quick quotes needed = templates save time ("Drywall repair - small", "Door hanging", etc.)
Often forgets small jobs = dashboard "To Invoice" section catches these
Peter's Quote Templates (Examples)
Template Name
Default Price
Typical Scope
Drywall patch - small
R450
Up to 30cm, includes paint touch-up
Drywall patch - large
R850
Up to 1m², includes sanding
Door hanging
R600
Standard internal door, door supplied by client
Tap washer replacement
R250
Parts included, single tap
Call-out fee
R350
Inspection/assessment only
These templates let Peter quote in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. Over 50 jobs/month, that's hours saved.
Case Study 5: Sarah — Home Baker & Cake Decorator
  ★★☆☆☆ WEAK FIT — Different business model entirely  
Business Profile
Business
Sarah's Sweet Creations
Location
Works from home in Sandton
Products
Custom cakes, cupcakes, cake pops for events
Orders per Month
15-25 orders
Average Order Value
R800 - R3,500
Monthly Revenue
R25,000 - R45,000
Why Sarah is NOT a Good Fit
Sarah's business is fundamentally different from a tradesperson:
What Sarah Needs
JobTrack Status
Order management (not quotes)
NO — built for quotes, not orders
Ingredient/inventory tracking
NO — no inventory features
Recipe costing
NO — not designed for this
Deposit tracking (50% upfront)
PARTIAL — can track partial payments
Delivery scheduling
NO — job scheduling is different
Photo gallery of past work
NO — not a portfolio feature
Customer contact details
YES — this works
What Sarah Actually Needs
Order management system (like CakeBoss, Bakesy)
Recipe costing calculator
Instagram/Facebook integration for bookings
Calendar with delivery/collection times
  RECOMMENDATION: Politely decline. Explain that JobTrack is built for tradespeople, not product-based businesses. Refer to bakery-specific software.  
Case Study 6: Willem — Pool Maintenance & Repairs
  ★★★★☆ GREAT FIT — Hybrid model works well  
Business Profile
Business
Crystal Clear Pools
Location
Bloemfontein
Team Size
Willem + 1 assistant
Services - Recurring
Weekly pool cleaning contracts (35 clients)
Services - Once-off
Pump repairs, filter replacements, green pool recovery, new installations
Revenue Split
60% contracts, 40% once-off repairs
Why Willem is a GREAT Fit
Willem has BOTH recurring contracts AND once-off quote work:
Once-off repairs (pump replacement, leak detection) = perfect for quote-job-invoice flow
Customer database = knows which client has which pump model, last service date
Photo records = before/after of green pool recovery (great for disputes)
40% of revenue is quote-based = clear ROI from not losing quotes
Handling Willem's Recurring Contracts (MVP)
For the weekly cleaning contracts, Willem can:
Store all contract clients in customer database with notes ("Weekly Monday, uses Kreepy Krauly")
Create monthly invoices manually (35 invoices, one-click each = 15 minutes)
Use JobTrack mainly for the repair/quote side of the business
Unlike the garden service, Willem's quote-based work is substantial enough to justify the subscription on its own. The contract side is a bonus.
Case Study 7: Ravi — Pest Control Services
  ★★★★☆ GREAT FIT — Quote-heavy with compliance needs  
Business Profile
Business
Ravi's Pest Solutions
Location
Port Elizabeth / Gqeberha
Team Size
Ravi + 2 technicians
Services
Residential & commercial pest control, fumigation, bird proofing
Jobs per Month
80-100 jobs
Job Mix
70% once-off callouts, 30% annual contracts
Why Pest Control Works Well
Mostly quote-based: "We have rats" → Quote → Job → Invoice
Compliance documentation: Needs to record what chemicals used, where applied
Photo evidence: Before/after photos important for commercial clients
Quote templates: Standard pricing for common pests (cockroaches, rats, ants)
Customer history: "Last treated 6 months ago for X" — valuable for callbacks
Case Study 8: Blessing — Painting Contractor
  ★★★★☆ GREAT FIT — Larger quotes, deposit tracking  
Business Profile
Business
Blessing Painters
Location
Polokwane
Team Size
Blessing + 4 painters (casual, paid per job)
Services
Interior/exterior painting, waterproofing, roof painting
Jobs per Month
8-12 jobs (larger projects)
Average Job Value
R8,000 - R45,000
Blessing's Specific Use Cases
Detailed quotes with line items: Labour, paint, primer, equipment, scaffolding hire
Deposit collection: Typically 50% upfront for materials — track partial payments
Before/after photos: Essential for disputes and testimonials
Job notes: "Client wants Plascon Cashmere in Stormy Sea for master bedroom"
Quote follow-up: Large quotes often take weeks to decide — reminders critical
Financial Impact for Blessing
Blessing's jobs are larger, so ONE recovered quote has massive ROI:
Average quote value
R20,000
Quotes sent per month
15
Estimated forgotten/lost quotes
2
Potential lost revenue per month
R40,000
JobTrack Pro cost (3 users for team)
R499
ROI if recovers ONE job
3,907%
Targeting Guide: Who to Pursue
🎯 PRIORITY 1: Actively Target These
  These customers have clear ROI and their business model matches JobTrack perfectly  
Solo plumbers and small plumbing teams
Electricians (1-5 people)
Handymen / general maintenance
Painters and decorators
HVAC / aircon technicians
Appliance repair technicians
Locksmiths
Tilers and floor installers
🟡 PRIORITY 2: Accept If They Come, Don't Chase
  These customers can use JobTrack but may need workarounds or Phase 2 features  
Pool services (hybrid contract + repairs)
Pest control
Garden services with significant once-off work (landscaping, tree felling)
Security installers (CCTV, alarms)
IT support / computer repair
Automotive mobile mechanics
🛑 PRIORITY 3: Politely Decline / Refer Elsewhere
  These businesses need different software — taking them will lead to churn and bad reviews  
Pure contract/schedule businesses (weekly cleaning, garden maintenance only)
Home bakers, crafters, makers (need order/inventory management)
E-commerce / online shops (need cart, shipping, inventory)
Restaurants / food service (need POS, table management)
Salons / spas (need appointment booking focus)
Tutors / coaches (need scheduling, not quotes)
Large construction companies (need project management, not job tracking)
The Key Question to Ask
When talking to a potential customer, ask this question:
  "What percentage of your work involves giving quotes to customers and waiting for them to say yes?"  
If > 50% = GREAT FIT
If 20-50% = PARTIAL FIT (might work)
If < 20% = NOT A FIT (politely decline)
