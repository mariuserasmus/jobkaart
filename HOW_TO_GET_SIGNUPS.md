# How to Get Your First 10 Signups - The Word-of-Mouth Strategy

## The Core Problem You Identified

You're absolutely right:
> "Most people just don't trust some websites anymore... unless it's word-of-mouth from someone they know\trust."

**This is THE insight that matters.** People trust **people**, not websites.

Your friends might be thinking:
- "How can this person I know have a valid\working website?"
- "Is this just a hobby project that'll disappear?"
- "Will my data be safe?"
- "What if it breaks and I lose everything?"

---

## The Solution: Borrowed Trust

You need to **borrow trust** from people tradies already trust.

### ❌ What DOESN'T Work (Cold Approaches):
- Posting "Check out my new app!" in Facebook groups
- Sending DMs to random tradies
- Paying for Facebook/Google ads (too expensive, no trust)
- Expecting people to sign up from your landing page alone

### ✅ What DOES Work (Warm Introductions):
- "My buddy Johan uses this and saved R12,000 last month"
- "The guy who made this helped me set it up personally"
- "I've been using it for 2 weeks and it's already caught 3 quotes I forgot about"
- "WhatsApp the developer - he'll help you for free"

---

## Phase 1: Get Your First 3 "Champion" Users (Week 1-2)

### Goal:
Get 3 tradies who:
1. Actually USE the product
2. See REAL value quickly
3. Will TELL their friends about it

### How to Find Them:

**Step 1: Make a list of tradies you know personally**
- Friends
- Family members who are tradies
- People who've done work for you
- Tradies in your contacts\network
- Church\gym\neighborhood contacts

**Step 2: Pick 3 who fit this profile:**
- ✅ Currently losing quotes\money (the problem is painful)
- ✅ Uses WhatsApp daily (comfortable with tech)
- ✅ Friendly\talkative (will tell people about it)
- ✅ You trust them to give honest feedback
- ❌ NOT your best friend who'll just sign up to be nice

**Step 3: Approach them with this script:**

> "Hey [Name], I need your help with something. I built a tool for SA tradies to stop losing quotes and get paid faster. I know you [mention their specific pain point - e.g., "were telling me you lost that R8,000 pool job because you forgot to follow up"].
>
> Can I set it up for you this weekend? I'll sit with you for 30 minutes, put your current quotes in, and show you how it works. If it's kak, tell me. If it helps you, tell your mates.
>
> 14-day trial, no card needed. I just need 3 honest people to use it and tell me what's broken."

**Key elements:**
- "I need YOUR help" (not "buy my product")
- Mention THEIR specific pain point
- Offer to set it up FOR them (remove friction)
- Make it clear you want honest feedback
- Time-box it ("30 minutes this weekend")

---

## Phase 2: Turn Champions into Proof (Week 2-4)

### Goal:
Get testimonials and word-of-mouth referrals from your 3 champions.

### Step 1: Check in after 1 week

WhatsApp them:
> "Hey [Name], been a week since we set up JobKaart. Have you sent any quotes with it yet? Has it helped catch anything you would've forgotten?"

**If yes:**
- Ask for specific numbers: "How many quotes did you send? How many follow-ups did it remind you about?"
- Ask for a testimonial: "Can I screenshot this conversation and use it on the website? I'll just show your first name + trade."

**If no (they haven't used it):**
- Don't give up - ask why:
  - "Too busy to learn it?" → Offer to sit with them again
  - "Didn't need to send quotes this week?" → Check back next week
  - "It's confusing?" → Fix what's broken

### Step 2: Ask for referrals

Once they've used it successfully:
> "Glad it's helping! Quick question - do you know any other [plumbers/electricians] who lose quotes or struggle with invoicing? I'm looking for 10 people to try it out. I'll set them up personally like I did for you."

**Offer an incentive:**
> "For every person you refer who signs up, I'll give you 1 month free once your trial ends."

### Step 3: Create social proof content

From your champions, create:

**1. Short testimonial for landing page:**
```
"I recovered a R4,500 quote in my first week that I would've forgotten about.
Already paid for itself."
— Johan, Plumber, Pretoria
```

**2. WhatsApp status update:**
Screenshot a testimonial or a quote sent via JobKaart and post to your WhatsApp status with:
> "Helped Johan from Pretoria recover a R4,500 quote he forgot about. If you're a tradie losing jobs in the cracks, let's chat."

**3. Facebook post in tradie groups:**
Don't post "Check out my app!"

Instead, post:
> "Question for plumbers/electricians: How many quotes do you send per month that you never follow up on?
>
> I built a tool to fix this after my buddy Johan lost R12,000 in 3 months from forgotten follow-ups. He's been using it for 2 weeks and already recovered 2 quotes.
>
> If you're losing money the same way, DM me. I'll set you up personally (free for 14 days)."

---

## Phase 3: Scale with Borrowed Trust (Week 4-8)

### Goal:
Turn 3 champions into 10 users through their networks.

### Strategy: Tradie Networks

Tradies talk to each other:
- At Builders Warehouse\Chamberlains
- In WhatsApp groups
- On job sites
- At braais

**Your job:** Make it easy for champions to refer people.

### Give champions a referral script:

Send them this WhatsApp message they can copy\paste:
> "Boet, you know how I'm always forgetting to follow up on quotes? I started using this app called JobKaart - it reminds me automatically.
>
> Recovered a R4,500 quote already that I would've forgotten about. The guy who built it is setting people up personally for free. Want me to intro you?"

**Key: They're not "selling" - they're sharing something that helped them.**

### Create a "Founder's Circle" WhatsApp group

Invite your first 10 users to a private WhatsApp group:
- Give them direct access to you
- Ask for feedback
- Share updates
- Answer questions fast

**This makes them feel special** and increases loyalty.

---

## Phase 4: The "Bring a Friend" Campaign (Week 8-12)

### Goal:
Get existing users to bring 1-2 friends each.

### Tactic: Team discount

Send this to all users:
> "JobKaart Update: You've been using JobKaart for [X] weeks. Here's what we're offering:
>
> **Bring a friend, you BOTH get 50% off for 3 months.**
>
> Just have them sign up and put your name in the 'Referred by' field. Once they're active, we'll apply the discount to both of you.
>
> Why? Because we're growing through word-of-mouth, not ads. You trust your mates more than we trust ads."

---

## Content That Builds Trust (Do This Weekly)

### 1. Behind-the-Scenes Updates

Post to Facebook\WhatsApp status weekly:
- "This week I helped Sipho from Joburg set up JobKaart. He sent 5 quotes in his first day."
- "Fixed a bug today that Thabo reported. This is why I love working with real tradies - you tell me what's broken."
- "Hit 10 users today! Thanks to everyone who's trying JobKaart. Your feedback is gold."

**Why this works:** People see you're REAL, RESPONSIVE, and ACTIVE.

### 2. Case Studies (Mini Stories)

Every 2 weeks, write a short case study:

**Example:**
> **How Sipho Recovered R8,000 in Forgotten Quotes (His First Month Using JobKaart)**
>
> Sipho is an electrician in Johannesburg. He sends 10-15 quotes per month.
>
> **His problem:** He'd send a quote via WhatsApp, the customer would say "let me think about it," and Sipho would forget to follow up. By the time he remembered, the customer had hired someone else.
>
> **What changed:** JobKaart reminds him automatically after 3 days if a quote hasn't been accepted.
>
> **Results in Month 1:**
> - Sent 12 quotes through JobKaart
> - Got reminded to follow up on 8 of them
> - Recovered 2 quotes worth R4,000 each (R8,000 total)
> - JobKaart cost: R299
> - ROI: 2,577%
>
> "I would've forgotten about both those jobs. JobKaart paid for itself in the first week." - Sipho
>
> [Call to action: If you're losing quotes like Sipho was, DM me.]

### 3. Transparency Updates

Be radically transparent:
- "We hit 5 users this week!"
- "Someone reported a bug - we fixed it in 2 hours"
- "Still figuring out pricing - your feedback helps"

**Why this works:** People trust honesty more than perfection.

---

## The "Trust Ladder" Strategy

Move people up the trust ladder:

### Level 1: Awareness (Low Trust)
- They see your post in a Facebook group
- They visit the landing page
- **Conversion rate: 1-2%** (expect 1 signup per 100 visitors)

### Level 2: Consideration (Medium Trust)
- Someone they know mentioned it
- They see a testimonial from someone like them
- **Conversion rate: 10-15%**

### Level 3: Decision (High Trust)
- A friend personally recommended it
- You offer to set it up FOR them
- They see you're active\responsive
- **Conversion rate: 40-60%**

**Your goal:** Move people from Level 1 → Level 3 as fast as possible.

## What to Do When People Say "I'll Think About It"

### If they say: "Let me think about it"
**Your response:**
> "No stress. Can I ask - what's making you hesitate? Is it the price, the setup, or something else? I'm genuinely trying to make this as useful as possible."

### If they say: "I don't trust putting my data online"
**Your response:**
> "I get it - I'd feel the same. Here's the thing: your data is encrypted with the same security banks use. And unlike a notebook in your bakkie, if something happens to your phone, your data is safe in the cloud. But I totally understand if you'd rather stick with what you know."

### If they say: "What if you shut down the app?"
**Your response:**
> "Fair question. I'm committed to this for at least 2 years - I've already invested [X hours/money] into building it. And if I ever did shut down, I'd give everyone 60 days notice and a way to export their data. But honestly, I'm just getting started."

### If they say: "I'll sign up later"
**Your response:**
> "Cool - I'll check in with you in 2 weeks. In the meantime, keep track of how many quotes you send that you forget to follow up on. That's the number that JobKaart is designed to fix."

---

## When You'll Know It's Working

### Good Signs:
- People message YOU asking about JobKaart (not the other way around)
- Users refer friends WITHOUT you asking
- People say "I wish I had this 5 years ago"
- Users stay past their 14-day trial

### Bad Signs:
- People sign up but never log in again
- No one is referring friends
- People cancel during trial
- You're the only one talking about JobKaart

**If you see bad signs:** Talk to users. Ask them what's missing or broken. Fix it before trying to get more signups.

---

## The Most Important Thing

### You're not selling software. You're solving a PAINFUL problem.

Every conversation should start with:
- "How many quotes did you send last month?"
- "How many did you forget to follow up on?"
- "How much money was that?"

If they say "I don't lose quotes," JobKaart isn't for them (yet).

If they say "Probably 2-3 per month at R4,000 each," then you say:
> "So you're losing R8,000-12,000 per month because you forget to follow up? JobKaart costs R299. If it helps you recover just ONE quote, you've paid for 13 months. Want me to set it up for you this weekend?"

## Remember:

> "Most people just don't trust some websites anymore... unless it's word-of-mouth from someone they know\trust."

You identified the problem perfectly. Now execute the solution:

**Borrow trust from people tradies already trust.**

---

**Good luck! You've got this.** 🚀

**P.S.** Once you hit 10 paying users, come back to this doc. The strategy changes at 10 → 50 users (community-led growth) and again at 50 → 100 users (content marketing).
